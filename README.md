# Healthcare RAG Agent

The Healthcare RAG Agent is an AI-powered chatbot using RAG, LangChain, Neo4j, and OpenAI GPT, built with Real Python's LLM RAG Chatbot Dataset.

P.S. The chatbot-api folder does not contain any api keys :) It was just named like that for convenience, don't worry.

## Why don't you check it out?

Start by cloning this repo and adding a `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```bash

NEO4J_URI=<YOUR_NEO4J_URI>
NEO4J_USERNAME=<YOUR_NEO4J_USERNAME>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD>

You can use the latest gpt-4o-mini instead of the gpt-3.5.

Next, navigate to the project root, start Docker, make sure your AuraDB instance is up and running, and then run:
```bash
make build
```
The build will start the servers, however, you can also start the server with the command:

```bash
make start
```
and stop all containers by running:

```bash
make stop
```
You can interact with the chatbot API docs on localhost:8000/docs, and the UI on localhost:8501:
